## CV

### Education

- PhD, The Open University, UK
- Msc, University of Camerino, Italy
- BSc, University of Camerino, Italy

Between October 2015 and March 2019 I was a doctoral candidate in Computing and Communications at The Open University, where I conducted interdisciplinary research in Interaction Design, Animal Biotelemetry, and Animal Behaviour.

During my Master's degree in Management of the Natural Environment at the University of Camerino, I specialised in monitoring methods of animal biodiversity.

I specialised in animal physiology during my Bachelor' s degree in Natural Sciences at the university of Camerino. This included six months of Erasmus studies at the University of Seville (Spain) where I studied neurophysiology.

### Research Experience
Since April 2019, I have been a Research Associate in Animal-Computer Interaction researching how to design interactive systems for non-human animals at The Open University.

From 2009 to 2012, I worked as a Research Assistant in various projects.
During this time, I obtained funds for collaborating with the group of Biogeographie of the University of Bayreuth
