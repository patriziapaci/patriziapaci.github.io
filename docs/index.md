# Research
I am a researcher at the [Animal-Computer Interaction Lab](http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/ACI/), The Open University.

My research focuses on
- Designing smart environments for the cognitive enrichment and welfare monitoring of captive animals.
- Ethical aspects of animal-centred interactive system design.
- Developing animal-centred interactive technology to improve the working experience of service dogs.
- Designing animal biotelemetry systems to improve their wearability.
- Developing design frameworks to enable systematic elicitations of animal-centred systems' requirements.

# Projects

##### *2014-2019*
My doctoral project on evaluating the wearability of GPS collars for cats, designing a wearer-centred prototype that improved wearability, and developing a design framework for establishing wearer-centred requirements for animal wearables. [Find out more](http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/ACI/?page_id=826). 

### EVENT project
##### *2010-2011*
Visiting researcher at Bayreuth University, working on the EVENT project to study the effects of extreme climatic events on vegetation. [Find out more](http://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/EVENT/index.php?lang=de).

# Curriculum Vitae

### Research Experience

- Research Associate, The Open University, UK
- Visting and then PhD researcher, The Open University, UK
- Research Assistant, University of Camerino, Italy & University of Bayreuth, Germany

Since April 2019, I have been a Research Associate in Animal-Computer Interaction, working on designing interactive systems for non-human animals at The Open University.

From October 2014 to September 2015, and then from October 2015 to March 2019, I researched how to design for wearability in animal biotelemetry.

From 2009 to 2012, I worked as a Research Assistant in projects on maritime telemedicine, wildlife monitoring, and climate change research.

### Teaching experience

- Associate Lecturer, Questions in Science, The Open University, UK
- Module Assistant, Evolutionary Biology, The Open University, UK
- PhD Third-Party Monitor, Research School, The Open University, UK
- Library Supporter for visually impaired researchers, The Open University, UK

### Education

- PhD, The Open University, UK
- MSc, University of Camerino, Italy
- BSc, University of Camerino, Italy

Between October 2015 and March 2019, I was a doctoral candidate in Computing at The Open University, where I conducted interdisciplinary research in Interaction Design, Animal Biotelemetry, and Animal Behaviour.

During my Master's degree in Management of the Natural Environment at the University of Camerino, I specialised in monitoring methods of animal biodiversity.

I specialised in animal physiology during my Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences at the University of Camerino. This included six months of Erasmus studies at the University of Seville (Spain), where I studied neurophysiology.
