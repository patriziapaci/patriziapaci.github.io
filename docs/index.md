Developing animal-centred technology to improve the working experience of service dogs and designing smart environments for the cognitive enrichment of captive animals.

## Projects

### Privacy-aware multispecies interaction Design and Applications
My research is currently focused on the development of privacy-aware systems to foster human-animal co-habitation 

### Dog-Smart Homes: Improving Accessibility for Mobility Assitance Dogs
Since 2020, I have coordinated

### Canine Signalling Interfaces for Bio Detection Dogs
I conducted the behavioural analysis of bio-detection dogs' spontaneous interactions with pressure sensors to provide the handler-dog signalling protocol with a reliable communication tool.

### Improving Wearability in Animal Biotelemetry
During my doctoral project, I evaluated the wearability of GPS collars for cats, developed a design framework for establishing wearer-centred requirements for animal wearables, and designed a wearer-centred protoype that improved the wearability for cats.

### The EVENT project
I was a visiting researcher at Bayreuth University, where I was part of the EVENT project to study the effects of extreme climatic events on vegetation.

## Curriculum Vitae

### Research Experience

- Research Associate, The Open University, UK
- Visting and then PhD researcher, The Open University, UK
- Researach Assistant, University of Camerino, Italy - University of Bayreuth, Germany

Since April 2019, I have been a Research Associate in Animal-Computer Interaction researching how to design interactive systems for non-human animals at The Open University.

From October 2014 to September 2015, and then from October 2015 to March 2019, I researcherd how to design for wearability in animal biotelemetry.

From 2009 to 2012, I worked as a Research Assistant in projects on maritime telemedicine, wildlife monitoring, and climate change research

### Teaching experience

- Associate Lecturer, Natural Sciences, The Open University, UK
- Module Assistant, Evolutionary Biology, The Open University, UK
- PhD Third-Party Monitor, Research School, The Open University, UK
- Library Supporter for visually impaired researchers, The Open University, UK

### Education

- PhD, The Open University, UK
- Msc, University of Camerino, Italy
- BSc, University of Camerino, Italy

Between October 2015 and March 2019 I was a doctoral candidate in Computing and Communications at The Open University, where I conducted interdisciplinary research in Interaction Design, Animal Biotelemetry, and Animal Behaviour.

During my Master's degree in Management of the Natural Environment at the University of Camerino, I specialised in monitoring methods of animal biodiversity.

I specialised in animal physiology during my Bachelor' s degree in Natural Sciences at the university of Camerino. This included six months of Erasmus studies at the University of Seville (Spain) where I studied neurophysiology.
